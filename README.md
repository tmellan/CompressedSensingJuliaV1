*The [original package](https://github.com/dahlend/CompressedSensing.jl) by dahlend doesn't work with current Julia due to some changes in the language, and is archived, so here is a Julia V1+ working version.*

This package contains several useful algorithms for compressed sensing, multiple measurement vectors, and sparse blind source separation.

##Available Algorithms

#####SMV - Single Measurement Vectors
- *IRLS* - Equality constrained Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares Lp Minimization [1][bib1]
- *UIRLS* - Unconstrained Iteratively Reweighted Lease Squares Lp Minimization [1][bib1]

#####MMV - Multiple Measurement Vectors
- *ZAP* - Zeropoint Attractor [2][bib2]

#####BSS - Sparse Blind Source Separation
- *nGMCA* - Sparse non-negative Blind Source Separation [3][bib3]

#####Quantifying Sparsity
- *GI* - Absolute Gini Index [4][bib4]
- *Coherence* - Measuring the coherence of a measurement matrix by the definitions commonly used [5][bib5]
